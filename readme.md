# README

This repository contains code examples for the DevNet Associate training courseware.

The goal for the training is to help people learn practical software development practices to help with network automation and other technology tasks as they use Cisco platforms for their jobs. In addition, we hope to help people identify what to study to pass a Cisco certification exam. The student can also find areas to study in more depth.
