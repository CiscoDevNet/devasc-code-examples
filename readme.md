# README

This repository contains code examples for the DevNet Associate training courseware.

The goal for the training is to help people learn practical software development practices to help with network automation and other technology tasks as they use Cisco platforms for their jobs. In addition, we hope to help people identify what to study to pass a Cisco certification exam. The student can also find areas to study in more depth.

The `sample-app` folder contains the files for the sample application from **Application deployment and security** > **Creating and deploying a sample application**.

The `src` folder contains completed code examples for all the hands-on exercises so you can try them in your own development environment. It includes a `requirements.txt` file that matches the in-browser development environment set up. Here are the libraries used in that file.

```
ansible
requests
PyYAML
flask
pyotp==2.3.0
pysqlite3==0.4.1
